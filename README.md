# FanChain Stamp DB

This repository contains the information files to map FANZ stamp values to their real world naming.

## Getting Started

### Stamp Color Usage

All stamps included in the FanChain stamp database have 3 brand colors associated with them: colorPrimary, colorSecondary and colorTertiary. For most use cases, colorPrimary is the only color that is needed. Dark mode support is built in by ensuring all colorPrimaryâ€™s have been double checked that they are visible on both light and dark backgrounds.

### API

This is the SWAGGER 2.0 JSON file for accessing the FanChain INFO api.  The API provides realtime updates to the database and allows for application access and caching.

### JSON

This is the JSON dump of the database based on the results from the INFO api's "/info/v1/stamp/all" results and contains the most up to date mapping and extra information.

### XLSX

This spreadsheet presents the data in a human readable format.
